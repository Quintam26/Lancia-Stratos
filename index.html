      <h3><b>History</b></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lancia Stratos, or more correctly, the Lancia Stratos HF (HF standing for High Fidelity) is a car developed by Italian design house Bertone for their fellow Italians over at Lancia. It was to be the first
        car developed from scratch for the World Rally Championship – specifically for the hotly contested Group 4 class, which would go on to become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_B">Group B</a> in 1983.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancia offered the Stratos in two major versions – the Stratos HF and the Stratos HF Stradale, the former was the stripped-back rally car and the latter was specifically modified for road use (in fact stradale
        is Italian for road) by slightly detuning the engine and adding some rudimentary items for increased comfort and convenience. That said, the Stratos was never intended as a grand tourer and attempting to use it as one would almost certainly end
        up with the driver in a physiotherapist’s waiting room.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a purpose-built rally car the Lancia Stratos HF was an extraordinary success, it started racing in Group 4 in 1974 after being homologated (requiring a production run of 500 units, later reduced to 400) and
        handily won the World Championship. It then won again in 1975 and 1976, and would likely have gone on to win more had it not been replaced by the Fiat 131 Abarth – a controversial decision by the Fiat Group.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1970s, the Lancia Stratos was a dominant force in the rallying world. Its mid-mounted engine, short overhangs, and light weight made it an ideal rally car, and in the mid 1970s, no one could touch it. The
        Stratos even won the World Rally Champion three years in a row—1974, 1975, and 1976.</p>
      <br>
<h4><b>New Stratos</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of the new Stratos has been underway since autumn 2008, at Pininfarina in Turin, Italy. The contemporary New Stratos is a non-commercial project by Michael Stoschek and his son Maximilian Stoschek. Together they played a fundamental role in determining the technical concept and design of the one-off vehicle.
